Buffers

Ships have 3 power buffers
Shots: (blue)
Shields: (white, yellow, red )
Accessory: (Green )

poweplant generates power, and each buffer can pull from it.
if a buffer is full then it's allotment of power gets split between the others that are not full.

Shots come off the shot buffer
Hits Come off the shield buffer.
Accessories and Fast Movement come off the Accessory Buffer.

Once power is in a buffer it can not be transftered to another buffer.

When Shields are down a ship explodes when it takes any damage.
