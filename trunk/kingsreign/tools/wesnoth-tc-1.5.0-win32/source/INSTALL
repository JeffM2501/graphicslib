Wesnoth Team Colorizer Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------------

The sources are intended to be built using the GNU Compiler Collection. You
will need to install the GNU C++ Compiler runtime and the libstdc++ development
files.

You'll also need the following libraries, with their development files
in an accessible, standard location:

- libpng 1.2.x
- Boost >= 1.35 (assignment, foreach and integer header-only libraries)

To compile, just do:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

If anything fails, that means that either your system lacks the required
development/runtime dependencies, or they are located at unusual places of your
disk.

To install:

  $ make install

Note that the default install prefix requires root privileges for installing.
If you cannot acquire root privileges, you may change the installation prefix
to a directory you can write to by passing --prefix=<dir> to the configure
script. See configure --help for more build-time options.

***

If you still have problems building this software, drop me an e-mail at
<shadowm2006@gmail.com> providing "[wesnoth-tc]" in the subject line. Quoting
the complete error messages, or better yet, attaching the complete config.log
is essential so I can have a clue of what's not working at your side.

I don't have easy access to other compilers than GCC, but if you get wesnoth-tc
working with them I'd appreciate a note about it and any additional steps
required to build wesnoth-tc with it.
