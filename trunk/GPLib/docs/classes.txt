Classes:

GPCore:
	The one singleton for the instance. handles platform capabilities, driver picking, and all the common stuff
	Hands out all the other sub classes.

GPCaps:
	Generated and filled out by the GPCore. Contains all the capabilities of the current platform. The class
	is passed to each platform subsystem and it fills out the respective sections.
	
GPDisplay:
	Abstract Display class, represents something that can be drawn on. Usualy a window ( fullscreen or not ), but may be a
	single display device ( caps will say that multiple displays are not allowed ).
	Handles all of the non OS specific OpenGL setup code.
	Virtualised so it can be derived from by client code.
	
GPDisplayBase:
	OS Specific pure virtual class. Handles the platform specific stuff dealing with displays. Does all the OS specific GL
	setup as well. Should have one of these per platform.
