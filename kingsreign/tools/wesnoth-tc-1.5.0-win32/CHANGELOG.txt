Wesnoth-TC ChangeLog
--------------------

Version 1.5.0-git:
- Now using autotools (configure) to produce suitable Makefiles.
- Loads of crappy and ugly code has been improved.
- Error handling has been improved.
- New --pal switch which is the wesnoth-tc counterpart to the game's ~PAL()
  image function.
- Output file naming has changed:
    - Color range targets (team color) are now in the form
      "filename-RC-keypalette-rangeid.png".
    - Palette switch targets are now in the form
      "filename-PAL-keypalette-targetpalette.png".
- Added new color ranges from mainline Wesnoth: lighred, darkred
- This can now be built for Win32 using Mingw32 using a cross-compiling
  environment from Debian GNU/Linux; it probably works with the native
  environment as well. However, libpng exception handling won't be
  available on these builds.

Version 1.0a:
- Fix build issues with glibc 2.7

Version 1.0:
- Workaround problems with working directory and
  missing RC definition file by using a brute-force
  approach.
- Fixed a nasty crash caused by missing
  definitions file.
- Tweaked Makefile and created Makefile.debug
  to produce debugging builds.

Version 0.90:
- First working version
